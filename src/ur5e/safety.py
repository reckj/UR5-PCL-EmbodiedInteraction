"""Safety limits — the framework's SECONDARY software guardrail.

STATUS: HS26 student framework, lower layer (sim-validated; cart_against_wall box
captured on the real cell).

IMPORTANT: this is NOT the robot's safety system. The authoritative, certified
safety layer is the robot's PolyScope Safety Configuration (joint limits, TCP
speed/force limits, safety planes). These software limits exist to catch
mistakes earlier and must always be set *more conservative than* the controller
configuration. They never replace it.

Profiles are swappable by name (like the host parameter) so the same code adapts
to different cell setups (cart against a wall now; 360°/truss later).

`validated=False` means the profile's geometry has not been confirmed against the
real cell (e.g. cart-top height not yet measured). Real-arm motion is refused
until a profile is validated; sim motion is allowed (geometry checks still run).
